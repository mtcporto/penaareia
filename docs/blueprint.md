- Background color: Off-white (#F8F8FF), subtly desaturated shade of the primary, provides a clean, neutral backdrop for the Kanban board.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#ADD8E6), an analogous color suggesting the ocean, differentiates key UI elements such as active buttons and selected cards.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern-looking sans-serif suitable for both headlines and body.
- Use flat design icons in the accent color, where appropriate, to represent sales activities and stages.
- Prioritize a clean and intuitive layout, optimizing for easy drag-and-drop functionality in the Kanban board.
- Incorporate subtle animations to indicate movement of cards between stages, providing clear feedback to the user.
